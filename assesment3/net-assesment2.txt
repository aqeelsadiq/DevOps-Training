QUESTION 2: Consider the 128.100.112.0/21 block of IP addresses. This block of addresses must be divided into four subnetworks that have each at least 500 IP addresses.

ANSWER: First, we find the number of IP addresses in each subnetwork.
formula to calculate the number of IP addresses on each subnet. (2^32-subnet mask) = 2^32-21=2^11=2048)
So the total number of IP addresses is 2048, and we divide it into 4 subnets, Dividing this block into /23 subnets so each subnet will have 512 IP addresses. more clear to understand that here 23 bit is reserved for network and 9 bits reserved for host so 2^9=512.

Subnet 1: 128.100.112.0/23   (128.100.112.0 to 128.100.112.255) (128.100.113.0 to 128.100.113.255)
subnet 2: 128.100.114.0/23   (128.100.114.0 to 128.100.114.255) (128.100.115.0 to 128.100.115.255)
subnet 3: 128.100.116.0/23
subnet 4: 128.100.118.0/23



QUESTION 3: An organization is assigned a class C network address of 201.35.2.0. It uses a netmask of 255.255.255.192. Using this netmask
a) How many subnets can be created. What are the address of the assigned subnetworks?
b) In each subnet, how many IPs each subnet will have

ANSWER:  default subnet mask of class C 255.255.255.0 but here netmask is 255.255.255.192 it means /26 is CIDR notation. 26 bits for network and 6 bit for host part.

a) The formula to calculate the number of subnets is:

number of subnets = 2^no.of subnet bits
Here, the number of subnet bits is 2 (since the difference between 26 and 24 is 2).
no.of subnets = 2^2 = 4

Subnet 1: 201.35.2.0/26

201.35.2.0 - 201.35.2.63
Network address: 201.35.2.0
Broadcast address: 201.35.2.63

201.35.2.64 to 201.35.2.127
network address: 201.35.2.62
Broadcast address: 201.35.22.127

subnet  3: 201.35.2.128/26

201.35.2.128 to 201.35.2.191

network address: 201.35.2.128
broadcast address: 201.35.2.191

subnet 4: 201.35.2.192

201.35.2.192 to 201.35.2.255
network address: 201.35.2.192
broadcast address: 201.35.2.255

b) Number of usable IP addresses are below
/26 2^6=64 total 64 no.of addresses on each subnet.
so 2^2-2=2^6-2=64-2=62 so 62 address are useful in each subnet.
