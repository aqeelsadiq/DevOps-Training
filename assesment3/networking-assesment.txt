QEUSTION: 1 Given these requirements
Base address: 142.150.235.0
Network mask: 255.255.255.224
Broadcast address: 142.150.235.31
Reserved Router address: 142.150.235.1
a) What is the address of the assigned subnetwork and what is the extended network prefix?
b) Which IP addresses can I use to configure the computers in my lab?
c) Suppose I wanted to do subdivide the assigned address block into 4 smaller subnetworks of equal size. How large are these networks, and how many IP addresses can I assign in each subnetwork?


Answer a) 
Base address: 142.150.235.0 (in binary 10001110.10010110.11101011.00000000)
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.224 (in binary  11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000)

we will perform AND operation between base address and subnet mask

10001110.10010110.11101011.00000000
1111111.11111111.11111111.11100000
result
10001110.10010110.11101011.00000000
so, the result is same as base adddress
The subnetwork address is the same as the base address: 142.150.235.0

extended network prefix is /27.   27 represents the 27 one in subnet mask.

Answer b)
With a /27 network, the total number of IP addresses is 2^32-27=5  2^5=32 addresses.
the first address is the network address (142.150.235.0) and the last address is the broadcast address (142.150.235.31).
Reserved Router address: 142.150.235.1
The usable IP addresses range from 142.150.235.2 to 142.150.235.30.


Answer c)
To subdivide a /27 network into 4 equal size. we need to move the subnet mask 2 bits to the right, and the result is  /29 prefix. This is because each subdivision increases the number of subnets by 2^n, where n is the number of bits we move. Here, we need 2^2=4 subnets.

2^32-29=2^3=8 addresses on each subnet.
Subnet 1)
Network address: 142.150.235.0
Usable IP addresses: 142.150.235.1 to 142.150.235.6
Broadcast address: 142.150.235.7
subnet 2)
Netwrok address: 142.150.235.8
Usable IP addresses: 142.150.235.9 to 142.150.235.14
Broadcast address: 142.150.235.15
Subnet 3)
Netwrok address: 142.150.235.16
Usable IP addresses: 142.150.235.17 to 142.150.235.22
Broadcast address: 142.150.235.23
Subnet 4)
Netwrok address: 142.150.235.24
Usable IP addresses: 142.150.235.25 to 142.150.235.30
Broadcast address: 142.150.235.31
so, we can use 6 IP address on each subnet and first and last is reserved for network and broadcast.
